# Sharpness Aware Minimization Project


In this project we will explore sharpness aware minimization.

This will require synthetically generating data and fine-tuning a model. Synthetic data has been known to have its own artifacts that originate from the LLM. In this paper, we aim to explore if we can use SAM to overcome some of these weaknesses.
